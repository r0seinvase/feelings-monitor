Feelings Monitor

This webpage was inspired mostly by the feelings friday event, A teamwork started with a concept from Paola Moreno-Reyes.

Styled and designed by Wael Gomaa, and made it work by the very bright teammates Charlie Kozey and Michael Dally.

The webpage in a nutshell is an anonymous way of venting out, A way to express and collect your feelings over time

Choose one of seven emotion that closely represents your mood and vent as much or as little as you want. 

Tell us your sorrows and troubles, celebrate or share the happiness and love.
